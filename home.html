              Results-driven Full Stack Developer with a solid foundation in web
              development acquired through a comprehensive bootcamp at Ironhack.
              Leveraging over 450 hours of intensive training, I have gained
              proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express, Node, and
              Mongoose. My adaptability and commitment to learning were
              demonstrated by successfully completing the program.<p> 
                <p>Complementing
              my technical skills, I hold a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design,
              bringing a creative perspective to development projects. My prior
              experience as a team lead in the dynamic environments of London
              and Barcelona has honed my ability to collaborate effectively with
              diverse teams. I am now enthusiastic about transitioning into the
              tech industry, eager to apply my unique blend of design expertise,
              leadership experience, and newly acquired full stack development
              skills to contribute to innovative projects in this evolving
              landscape.</p>
